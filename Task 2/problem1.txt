This program will allow the user to check the number whether it's divisible by 3 or not

Declare integers
 number1, reminder, sum, number2
enter number
assign 
number2=number1
assign 
sum=0
while 
number2 is not equal to 0
assign 
reminder = number2 modulus 10
assign
sum = sum+reminder
assign 
number2= number2 divided by 10
stop the while loop
if "sum modulus 3 equals to 0"
print response
 "True"
Then "sum modulus 3 not equals to 0"
print respone 
"False"
