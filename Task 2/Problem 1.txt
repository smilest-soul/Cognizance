This program will allow the user to check the number whether it's divisible by 3 or not



Declare integers
a, reminder, sum, n
enter number
assign
n=a
assign
sum=0
while
n is not equal to 0
assign
reminder = n modulus 10
assign
sum = sum+reminder
assign
n= n divided by 10
stop the while loop
if "sum modulus 3 equals to 0"
print response
"True"
if "sum modulus 3 not equals to 0"
print respone
"False"
